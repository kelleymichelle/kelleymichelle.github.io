                       OBJECT ORIENTATION. OBJECT ORIENTATION IS WHAT BWINGS US TOGETHER TODAY. 
		
		As an even newerer coder(than now), I had heard horror stories whispered around the campfire about the nuisances of Object Orientation. Since I started the section on Object Orientation, I felt so many bridges connect inside my head and a lightbulb went off. It just makes so much sense. I can see the why and the how- it's like organization through code. I can vibe with that so hard!
		
		 When I started the pre-course work, each line of code I wrote was exciting. Typing it, seeing it pass the rspec tests, and seeing the results was exhilarating. In the beginning, I was asking so many questions on the AAQ. So many kudos to those fabulous individuals who delve into the thought processes of frustrated student after frustrated student. I would come away with a greater understanding of the concept I was struggling with and also have another insight to a different thought process. 
		 
		 Since starting OO, things make more sense. I can see puzzle pieces starting to fit together and it doesn't seem so impossible anymore. I'm really enjoying learning so far and am excited to see where this takes me.
