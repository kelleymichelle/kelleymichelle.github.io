Ah Javascript. First we learned how to create and organize elegant, beautiful code. This elegant code had its own place in a program and was neat and clean and tidy. 

Enter Javascript. Javascript storms in with its curly brackets and semicolons and vomits on your computer screen. You look at it and go 'what the actual fuck is this???' You go from creating partials that were rolled together crisp white socks to a mostly blank html file and a script tag. Inside your javascript "script" is a mess of fUnCtIoNs. Think the rolled crisp white socks vs 3 week old avocado ankle socks with cat hair stuck on the bottom permanently. 

Everything is now a function. wakeUp(). drinkCoffee(), learnSomeCode(), walkTheDog()... Your life has become one huge function that calls a function inside of a function inside of a function. Reality is just a callback function. There are only functions in your life now. The words and terms you thought you knew have all changed and there's probably a function for it. You are on a new planet and you arrived there via function. 

I started my JS and Rails project 3 weeks early. I decided early on that I needed to create a game for whatever reason. I decided upon a seemingly easy tile matching game. You know the ones- you match 2 pictures and you keep that match. The one's that small children are always losing pieces too and it then becomes useless? Yes, I coded that. 

My project is affectionately titled "Matchy-Match". It was actually a lot of fun to make and work through challenges I encountered. A player inputs their name and selects a level. Level selection creates half the tiles needed for that level in the backend. My frontend assigns a cute kitty picture to the back of each tile then clones the tiles so there are 2 exact matches of each one. 

I spent 2 whole days figuring out how to make a tile flip over individually and using CSS transitions. Another couple days were spent on taking 2 flipped tiles and comparing them to see if they were exact matches then removing them from the game board. There was a lot of what I like to call "creative coding" I played with and I had so much fun watching my creation come together. After that fun I had with it I spent too much time playing it so I could somewhat populate the high score board. I never want to see matching tiles again. 

Learning "Vanilla" Javascript has at least made me feel like less of a fraud. I can say that I can code now and not feel the need to mumble over the words completely. I played cheerleader to my special "cOdInGfRiEnD" who was convinced he wasn't grasping the material and I couldnt be more proud at how he rose to the oppurtunity to go above and beyond the learning material presented to make certain he knew what he needed to.  

2020. The Roaring 20s. The 1920's earned it's famous nickname for its freespirited exuberent lifestyle that came with it's pop culture. This year I turn 30. This year I'll graduate school. This year I'm making the biggest move of my life. This year my entire life will change. I can taste it. This is MY year. Bring on the roaring 20's because I'm so ready.

This is the home stretch now. We're almost there.
