We started at the bottom now we're here. *insert club music here*

Here we are with a graduation "dashboard". Here we are with career coaching and everything else that's pulling the entire course together. 

Today I wrote out how each piece of Redux works and flows together. Now I can visualize it encapsulating React and holding things inside of a bubble that surrounds it completely. 

Or something like that... 

I started coding almost a year ago. It was a mix of things that led me to that path where I was writing my first line of HTML and felt like a total badass. 

Single mom with 3 kids. Cocktail waitressing downtown New Orleans to make money. I didn't have anything that was just for ME. I would tell anyone who asked me how I liked working at the club if I liked it. My answer was always "It's good money but I want a CAREER. I want to do something I get excited about." One day someone suggested I go into coding. Around the same time I heard talk of coding bootcamps. 

I hate taking the leap. I definitely have a fear of failure. If I know I can do it, the anxiety melts away and I can shine. Fear of failure can definitely feel crippling. I needed to learn coding before I could learn coding. I started codecademy's HTML and CSS courses. I loved it. I loved writing something and having it turn into useable stuff. It felt magical.  

Fast forward and I'm finishing up my final section of coding bootcamp. Coding has become my life for the past year. I've pushed myself to learn new things and create on a whole different level. It's so easy to let myself get lost in code for hours at a time. 

I'm so proud of myself for actually sticking to it and getting this far. I doubted myself. I doubted I could do it and I doubted that I could stick with it. 

Learning JavaScript felt like a defining moment for me in learning to code. It was like ok if you can figure this out you can really do it. 

Here I am. Almost finished bootcamp and I feel like I can say I'm a CODER now.
