*"You might be a puzzle, but I like the way the parts fit" - Frank Sinatra*

Insert spilled rocks glass image here. Wasted whiskey all over the keyboard and a crying coder with a messy bun wondering why in the world their view wasn't rendering. 

It took me an incredibly long time to find a unique and fun topic to choose. Ideas were dismissed as rapidly as they came to me. The topic I eventually settled on was gymnastics skill by level. My littlest sister, Emily, is very very into gymnastics. She's 14 and is training to join the Olympic team when she's old enough. Everyday, she's in the gym. At home, she's on her hands upside down. She lives and breathes gymnastics. In gymnastics, you master skills by level. You cannot advance to higher levels until you've mastered all the skills in one level. I named my program Gym Starz. You're a gymnastics gym. You signup and can add many gymnasts that attend your gym. You can add skills to each gymnast by level via checkboxes. The skills by level are the actual official skills listed down by the official group. I like that it could potentially be something useful. 

Creation feels amazing. The thought that I type something into a text editor and I can see it on the internet it awesome. I love learning skills and utilizing them. I especially enjoy that I can bring this to my little sister or my parents and even if they don't understand remotely exactly how it was done or why it works they can understand that I made it and it does something they can relate to. It gives me a light at the end of the tunnel and confidence that maybe, just maybe, I could do this and make a life out of it. Not gymnastics- I think that ship has sailed- but coding and creating. 

During this section I've coded in an airplane, across the country, sleeping overnight in a hospital watching over an ill  parent, on zoom for countless hours with "coding" "friends", grieving the loss of a friend, and enjoying the company of someone I've come to love. My day's are a whirlwind of trying to balance learning this new skillset and trying to be a good parent to my children. 

We started at "Hello World" and look how far we've come! I can't believe we're almost through Sinatra projects. I see students drop from my cohort and it feels a little like Hunger Games and I hear the cannon go off. Your connections and friendships that you cultivate will be what carry you through a program like this- even online. We all have something to can teach each other and someone to learn something from. I can remember struggling through arrays and iteration and now it all seems so very basic. I'm so excited to see what we learn next.
