Can anyone else smell impending graduation in the air??? Or is that the smell of panic, hysteria, and nation-wide lockdown? Hard to tell. 

Today marks the beginning on our second project week and our last official week of school. It feels surreal that I made it through and now I'm at the end. A year ago I was writing basic HTML and just starting out on this journey and today I'm feeling like a complete fraud sending pRoFeSsiOnAl emails looking for a job as a software engineer. 

I remember being in Elementary school, being in first grade and looking at the third graders. They seemed so big and wise and I could never imagine being in third grade. I felt that same feeling when I started bootcamp and saw everyone working on their Rails or final projects. Like wow I'll never make it there. Somehow that's exactly where I made it. I made it to where I'm nitpicking on details about my project and telling myself "Kelley just stop touching it." 

I never knew what I wanted to do and what I was actually capable of. Now that I did it and I know it, I can just pray that an employer sees it and wants to hire me. 

For my final project I made a dating app. I called it Color Connection. This application has a user sign up, then directs them to take a personality quiz that assigns them a "color token" that gives insight into their personality. They can search users by color token or zodiac. Once they like another user they can message them directly. This was way more involved than I imagined going in. Figuring out likes dynamically yet would also save to the server side properly was an adventure. Figuring out messaging was a whole other adventure. Lots of adventures happening. 

I don't know what the future holds. I know none of us do but at times I feel more secure than others. I really want to create something that changes the world. Something just totally awesome that everyone knows what it is. Maybe I'll get there, who knows. But I'll definitely keep coding, and learning, and pressing onwards and upwards.
